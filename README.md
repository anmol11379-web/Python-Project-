# HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# OBJECTIVE 
This Hospital Management System is a Python program that helps hospitals manage records of patients, doctors, and workers digitally. It allows users to register new entries, view and search records by ID, update details, and delete records. The data is securely saved using file storage, so information is kept even after closing the program. Access is protected by a login system, making it easy and efficient for hospital staff to handle important information without paper files or complex databases.

# FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT 
1. Secure login for authorized access.
2. Register new patient, doctor, and worker records with details like name, age, department/work, contact, and ID.
3. View lists of all patients, doctors, or workers.
4. Search individual patients, doctors, or workers by their unique ID.
5. Update important fields such as patient medical problems, doctor departments, and worker job types.
6. Delete records of patients, doctors, or workers safely by ID.
7. Persistent file-based storage using Python’s pickle module to save all data between sessions.
